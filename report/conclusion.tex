\section{A Final Word}

This project was intensely enjoyable and challenging, encapsulated by a spectrum
of emotions from frustration to euphoria. If I had my time again I'd do a lot
of things differently, and that is the measure of a great learning experience.

I would like to finish by expressing my gratitude to those who helped with the
project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thanks to my girlfriend, Shirley, and my mother, Mary, for proof-reading
and endless cups of Earl Grey.
\item Thanks to James Doherty and the System Administrators in the Computer
Science Department for the constant advice, backup and support throughout the
project. Fortunately I didn't have occasion to avail of it very often, but I
always knew it was there if I needed it.
\item Thanks to Professor Provan, and all the others who came to see my project
on open day.
\item And finally, many thanks to Dr.\ Manning, who provided inspiration,
guidance, great advice, and a truly fascinating project.
\end{itemize}
