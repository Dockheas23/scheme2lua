Creating wrappers for the Scheme data was a mistake, both in terms of the time
it consumed in development and testing, and the likely effect it had on
performance. It simplified the translator at the expense of the size,
readability and complexity of the translated program. Priority should have been
given to the output over the translator, and more effort should have been made
to find a simple solution.


\section{Further Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Continuations
\item Syntax Extension
\item File I/O
\item Full coverage of the Scheme language
\end{itemize}


\section{A Final Word}

This project was intensely enjoyable and challenging, encapsulating a spectrum
of emotions from frustration to euphoria. It was an unrivaled opportunity for me
to let loose and have fun with computer languages, learning two new ones along
the way; but knowing how much this project means to Dr.\ Manning, I also felt a
responsibility to do it justice. If I had my time again I'd do some things
differently, and that is the measure of a great learning experience.

I would like to finish by acknowledging those who helped with the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thanks to my girlfriend, Shirley, and my mother, Mary, for proof-reading
and endless cups of Earl Grey.
\item Thanks to James Doherty and the System Administrators in the Computer
Science Department for the constant advice, backup and support throughout the
project. Fortunately I didn't have occasion to avail of it very often, but I
always knew it was there if I needed it.
\item Thanks to Professor Provan, and all the others who came to see my project
on open day.
\item And finally, many thanks to Dr.\ Manning, who provided inspiration,
guidance, great advice, and a truly fascinating project.
\end{itemize}
