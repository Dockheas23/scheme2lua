\begin{abstract}
Scheme and Lua are two neat programming languages that have many similarities
and many differences. This project is an exploration of the relationship between
them. It takes the form of a one-way source-to-source translator from Scheme to
Lua, aimed at uncovering the gamut of expressibility, and finding insights into
the essence of computer languages. \\[10mm]
