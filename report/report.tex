\chapter{The Translator (20 pages)}

The initial approach involved finding for each construct in Scheme, its most
precise and efficient representation in Lua. In French parlance, this is nicely
described by the phrase ``le mot juste'', meaning ``the precise word'' or ``the
perfect word'', and it brings to mind the image of an expert translator of
human languages, who knows through experience how to accurately convey the
intended semantic of each phrase from one language to another for a particular
context.  This seemed like a reasonable and credible way of proceeding given
the small size of the core of the Scheme language.
